# mobileApps
The modules that are contained in this directory were projects developed in my Introduction to Mobile Application Course at Community College.

There are several programs showcasing my skills in Mobile Application for building apps for Android devices as well as Apple devices.
Some of the projects are split up and organized into subdirectories where you can also download the zipfile for personal use.

For the Xcode projects we were not required to have any prior experience with coding in Swift. 
So we used the storyboard interface and plugged in code along the way with tutorials/lessons learned in the classroom. 

(Experience)

[Xcode]
- We explored the key components of an iOS app project and their roles in app development.  
- We gained hands-on experience using the IDE Library to add interface elements, such as labels, containers, and buttons, to the main storyboard.  
- We utilized the Attributes Inspector in the IDE to customize the features and properties of UI elements.  
- We ran the applications in the IDE's built-in simulator to test and observe functionality.  
- We added interactivity to UI elements by configuring their behaviors, allowing users to interact with them.  
- This was achieved in the view controller by establishing "outlet" and "action" connections.  
- We created variables linked to UI elements, enabling them to respond to user interactions.  
- We designed custom app icons to visually represent the application on the device's home screen.  
- We implemented Tab Bar and Navigation Controllers to facilitate seamless navigation between different screens.  
- We modified UI element properties to enhance the user interface.  
- We organized image assets in the Asset Catalog for efficient management and integration into the app.  
- We linked multiple elements to respond dynamically to user input.  
- We utilized the color dialog box to customize the appearance of UI components.  
- We created duplicate instances of elements when needed for consistency and efficiency.  
- We wrote functions and methods to define actions for variables and UI elements.  
- We implemented Boolean conditions to manage and display the status of specific elements.
