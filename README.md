# mobileApps
The modules in this directory represent projects developed during my Introduction to Mobile Application Development course at Community College.

These programs highlight my skills in mobile app development, showcasing apps built for both Android and Apple devices. Some projects are organized into subdirectories, where you can also download zip files for personal use.

For the Xcode projects, no prior experience with Swift was required. We utilized the storyboard interface to design user interfaces and incorporated code progressively, guided by classroom lessons and tutorials.

(Experience)

[Xcode]
- We explored the key components of an iOS app project and their roles in app development.  
- We gained hands-on experience using the IDE Library to add interface elements, such as labels, containers, and buttons, to the main storyboard.  
- We utilized the Attributes Inspector in the IDE to customize the features and properties of UI elements.  
- We ran the applications in the IDE's built-in simulator to test and observe functionality.  
- We added interactivity to UI elements by configuring their behaviors, allowing users to interact with them.  
- This was achieved in the view controller by establishing "outlet" and "action" connections.  
- We created variables linked to UI elements, enabling them to respond to user interactions.  
- We designed custom app icons to visually represent the application on the device's home screen.  
- We implemented Tab Bar and Navigation Controllers to facilitate seamless navigation between different screens.  
- We modified UI element properties to enhance the user interface.  
- We organized image assets in the Asset Catalog for efficient management and integration into the app.  
- We linked multiple elements to respond dynamically to user input.  
- We utilized the color dialog box to customize the appearance of UI components.  
- We created duplicate instances of elements when needed for consistency and efficiency.  
- We wrote functions and methods to define actions for variables and UI elements.  
- We implemented Boolean conditions to manage and display the status of specific elements.
